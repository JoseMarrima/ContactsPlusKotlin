This is a Contacts app based on Model–View–Viewmodel (MVVM), Dagger, Coroutines, Data Binding, Navigation, Room, Livedata, Constraint Layout, Material Design and Unit Testing Using Mockito and Junit. This is an app that presents a list of cards in the main page, and each card on this main page will contain the name and profile picture. Additionally, this main page will contain a floating action button, so a new contact card can be added.
